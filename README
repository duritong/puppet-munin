== Munin ==

Munin is a performance monitoring system which creates nice RRD graphs and has
a very easy plugin interface. The munin homepage is http://munin.projects.linpro.no/

To use this module, follow these directions:

1. Install the "common" and "concat" module -- the munin module depends on functions
   that are defined and installed via these modulesh, see README.common for how to do
   this

2. You will need storedconfigs enabled in your puppet setup, to do that you need to
   add a line to your puppet.conf in your [puppetmasterd] section which says:
   
   storeconfigs=true

   You may wish to immediately setup a mysql/pgsql database for your storedconfigs, as
   the default method uses sqlite, and is not very efficient, to do that you need lines
   such as the following below the storeconfigs=true line (adjust as needed):

   dbadapter=mysql
   dbserver=localhost
   dbuser=puppet
   dbpassword=puppetspasswd

3. Install the "munin" module:

   a. Your modules directory will need all the files included in this repository placed 
      under a directory called "munin"

   b. Add your hiera storage value for munin_allow which indicates what IP should be allowed to 
      connect to your individual munin-nodes (this is typically your main munin host's IP):

      munin_allow: '192.168.0.1'
      
      If you want to define more than one host, you can define them as an array:

      munin_allow: ['127.0.0.1','192.168.0.1']

   c. In the node definition in your site.pp for your main munin host, add the following:

      include munin::host
   
   d. On each node that will gather munin statistics, add this line to that node's entry 
      in site.pp (you may want to also add this to your main munin host):
      
      include munin::client

   e. If there are particular munin plugins you want to enable or configure, you define them
      in the node definition, like follows:

      # Enable monitoring of disk stats in bytes
      munin::plugin { df_abs: }

      # Use a non-standard plugin path to use custom plugins
      munin::plugin { "spamassassin":
         ensure => "spamassassin",
         script_path => "/usr/local/share/munin-plugins",
      }

      # Use a special config to pass parameters to the plugin
      munin::plugin {
         [ "apache_accesses", "apache_processes", "apache_volume" ]:
            ensure => present,
            config => "env.url http://127.0.0.1:80/server-status?auto"
      }


   f. If you have Linux-Vservers configured, you will likely have multiple munin-node processes
      competing for the default port 4949, for those nodes, set an alternate port for munin-node
      to run on by putting something similar to the following in hiera's node scope:

      munin_port: 4948

   g. If you'd like to do cgi graphing, please note the following page: http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/CgiHowto
      For CentOS this is enabled in the default header config

   h. Per default (on CentOS) munin will send warnings and critical messages to root
